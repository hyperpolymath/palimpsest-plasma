== Overview

Palimpsest Plasma is a Palimpsest ecosystem repository. See `ROADMAP.adoc` and
the `docs/` directory for project details.

== License

This project is licensed under the **Palimpsest-MPL License 1.0 (PMPL-1.0)**.
Use SPDX identifier **PMPL-1.0-or-later** in file headers and metadata.

See `LICENSE` for the full legal text.

== MVP v1 Focus

Palimpsest Plasma is now delivering the **MVP v1** bundle for creators who want a
deployable PMPL-1.0 experience:

* **Canonical license tooling** – keep the shared `LICENSE` text, ECOSYSTEM mapping,
  and badges aligned with the Palimpsest Stewardship Council’s PMPL-1.0 release.
* **Badge & documentation assets** – ship the `assets/badges/` pack and the
  `docs/mvp-v1.adoc` roadmap so integrations can adopt the v1.0 brand.
* **Compliance readiness** – capture SPDX metadata, automated checks, and audit
  command examples in `docs/mvp-v1.adoc` and `STATE.scm`.
* **Audit/playback support** – use `pmpl-verify`/`pmpl-audit` to confirm the repo
  meets the provenance expectations described in `palimpsest-license/VERSIONING.adoc`.

See `docs/mvp-v1.adoc` for the full deliverables checklist and compliance commands.
