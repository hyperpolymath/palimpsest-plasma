== Overview

**palimpsest-plasma** is the official governance automation engine for the
Palimpsest-MPL ecosystem. It is an OCaml-based system that interprets the
licence, exhibits, and governance rules as typed, machine-readable policies, and
evaluates real-world repository states against those obligations.

PLASMA stands for the operational, programmable substrate that keeps the
Palimpsest-MPL ecosystem correct, compliant, and narratively coherent over time.

== Core Responsibilities

=== Compliance & Verification

* Validate SPDX headers, provenance manifests, exhibit references, governance
  metadata, and release requirements
* Detect violations, omissions, inconsistencies, and structural drift
* Produce actionable findings for maintainers and auditors

=== Corrective, Adaptive, and Perfective Maintenance

* Suggest or apply fixes (missing headers, outdated links, incorrect exhibit
  references)
* Adapt to structural changes in the repository
* Improve documentation, governance artefacts, and provenance flows

=== Governance Runtime

* Enforce Council decisions
* Track exhibit lifecycle changes
* Validate versioning rules
* Ensure governance processes are followed

=== Policy Engine

* Parse and evaluate obligations, prohibitions, permissions, and conditions
* Support versioned policy schemas with migrations
* Allow exhibits to extend or modify rules

=== Audit & Reporting

* Generate structured audit logs
* Produce compliance reports
* Support legal, governance, and provenance reviews

=== Integration

* CLI tool for local checks
* Git hooks for pre-commit/pre-push enforcement
* GitHub Actions for CI enforcement
* Optional daemon/cron mode for periodic audits

== Architecture

OCaml core for stability, correctness, and long-term maintainability. The engine
is structured in three layers:

* **core/** -- Canonical PLASMA substrate: Policy AST, schemas, evaluation,
  migrations, facts, findings, actions, governance runtime
* **integration/** -- Surfaces: CLI, git hooks, CI, daemon
* **adapters/** -- IO and environment-specific collectors/parsers: SPDX, exhibits,
  repo topology

See link:docs/architecture.adoc[docs/architecture.adoc] for the full design,
link:docs/policy-ast-v0.1.adoc[docs/policy-ast-v0.1.adoc] for the typed AST
specification, and link:TOPOLOGY.md[TOPOLOGY.md] for a visual architecture map.

== Sub-Projects

=== union-policy-parser

A Rust-based policy validation engine for union contracts (NUJ, IWW, UCU) using
A2ML (Attested Markup Language). Parses and validates employment contracts
against union standards with formal proofs and grievance generation. See
`union-policy-parser/` for full details.

== MVP v1 Bundle

The **MVP v1** bundle provides a deployable PMPL-1.0 experience:

* **Canonical license tooling** -- `LICENSE` text, ECOSYSTEM mapping, and badges
  aligned with the Palimpsest Stewardship Council’s PMPL-1.0 release
* **Badge & documentation assets** -- `assets/badges/` pack and `docs/mvp-v1.adoc`
* **Compliance readiness** -- SPDX metadata, automated checks, audit commands
* **Audit/playback support** -- `pmpl-verify`/`pmpl-audit` provenance verification

See `docs/mvp-v1.adoc` for the full deliverables checklist and compliance commands.

== Static Site

Compliance guidance builds through a local Elixir mix project at `site/`. Run
`mix site.build` from that folder to regenerate `site/_site`. The GitHub Actions
workflow in `.github/workflows/nimble-site.yml` deploys the generated pages.
