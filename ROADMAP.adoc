== Current Status

The MVP v1 bundle (badges, compliance docs, SPDX metadata, audit commands) is
**complete**. The union-policy-parser sub-project (Rust/A2ML) is functional.
The core PLASMA engine (OCaml) is now in the design-to-implementation phase.

== Completed Milestones

=== v1.0.0 — MVP v1 Bundle [COMPLETE]

* [x] Finalise PMPL-1.0 licence text and README
* [x] Ship badge + embed documentation from docs/mvp-v1.adoc
* [x] Update ECOSYSTEM/STATE metadata and release log

=== v1.1.0 — Metadata & Discoverability [COMPLETE]

* [x] Add CITATION.cff for academic citation support
* [x] Add codemeta.json for software metadata interoperability
* [x] Add .well-known/security.txt and .well-known/ai.txt
* [x] Update STATE.scm to reflect additions

=== union-policy-parser v0.1 [COMPLETE]

* [x] A2ML parser (nom-based, Rust)
* [x] Union schema definitions (NUJ, IWW, UCU, BECTU, Equity, GMB)
* [x] Contract validator with three modes (Lax, Checked, Attested)
* [x] Grievance generator (JSON, Markdown, HTML output)
* [x] Example contracts (good and bad)
* [x] Idris2 ABI definitions and Zig FFI layer

== Active Milestones

=== v2.0.0 — PLASMA Engine Foundation

* [ ] OCaml project layout (dune-project, opam, src/core)
* [ ] Policy AST v0.1 implementation
* [ ] Schema versioning and migration framework
* [ ] Mock migration tests
* [ ] Fact collection types and adapters
* [ ] Finding types with severity and kind

=== v2.1.0 — Evaluation Engine

* [ ] Condition compiler (AST conditions -> fact predicates)
* [ ] Rule evaluator (modality + action -> findings)
* [ ] Policy evaluator (iterates rules, collects findings)
* [ ] Integration tests with example policies and repos

=== v2.2.0 — Action Planner

* [ ] Action types (AddSpdxHeader, UpdateExhibitReference, etc.)
* [ ] Suggest vs Apply modes
* [ ] Planner: findings -> planned actions
* [ ] Backup and rollback support

=== v2.3.0 — CLI

* [ ] `plasma check` — validate repo against policy
* [ ] `plasma fix` — plan or apply corrective actions
* [ ] `plasma audit` — generate structured audit logs
* [ ] `plasma governance` — Council decision integration
* [ ] `plasma migrate` — policy schema migration
* [ ] Human and JSON output formats

== Planned Milestones

=== v2.4.0 — Integration Surfaces

* [ ] Git hooks (pre-commit, pre-push)
* [ ] GitHub Actions reference workflow
* [ ] `.plasma.toml` configuration
* [ ] Daemon/cron mode for periodic audits

=== v2.5.0 — Governance Runtime

* [ ] Council decision enforcement
* [ ] Exhibit lifecycle tracking (active, superseded, deprecated)
* [ ] Versioning rule validation
* [ ] Policy overlay composition

=== v3.0.0 — Contractiles

* [ ] Contractile type definitions
* [ ] Reversible commitment semantics
* [ ] State-space narrowing evaluation
* [ ] Integration with action planner
* [ ] Constraint propagation across rules

=== v3.1.0 — PLASMA + union-policy-parser Integration

* [ ] A2ML documents as fact sources for PLASMA
* [ ] Shared exhibit and attestation model
* [ ] Combined compliance reporting

== Future Directions

* Formal verification of policy evaluation (Coq or Lean proofs)
* WASM compilation target for browser-based policy checks
* Visual policy editor
* Multi-repo fleet evaluation (gitbot-fleet integration)
* AI-assisted policy authoring
