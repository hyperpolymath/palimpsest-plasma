= Palimpsest Plasma MVP v1 Roadmap
:toc:
:toclevels: 3

== Purpose

Palimpsest Plasma MVP v1 packages the minimal combination of assets, tooling, and
audit guidance that lets creative projects adopt **PMPL-1.0 (SPDX: PMPL-1.0-or-later)**
with confidence. It bundles the canonical license text, adaptive badge designs, and
compliance checklists together with governance guidance from *Palimpsest License*.

== Deliverables

* **Legal alignment** – keep a single `LICENSE` file referencing PMPL-1.0, with badge
  references sourced from `assets/badges/svg/badge-standard.svg`.
* **Badge & embed pack** – publish the complete badge asset set plus Markdown/HTML
  snippets (see `assets/badges/` and `palimpsest-license/embed/license-blocks/`) for
  reuse by downstream repos.
* **Roadmap & documentation** – describe MVP v1 goals, milestones, and compliance steps
  in this file and link back to `palimpsest-license/VERSIONING.adoc`.
* **Compliance automation** – add `STATE.scm` metadata, `Justfile` hints, and an audit
  script description so the repository can be validated automatically.
* **Audit readiness** – verify the repository with Palimpsest tooling (`pmpl-verify`,
  `pmpl-audit`) and capture the commands/output below.

== Milestones

The MVP v1 release targets the following milestones:

* **1.0.0 license release** – PMPL-1.0 text finalized, SPDX headers standardized,
  README badges updated, and `LICENSE` / `ECOSYSTEM.scm` reflecting the canonical
  stewarding council guidance.
* **Badge & compliance pack** – `assets/badges/` holds the v1.0 badge family, while
  `docs/mvp-v1.adoc` documents where to place badges, license blocks, and metadata.
* **Audit & release artifacts** – `STATE.scm` lists release artifacts (docs, badges,
  audit log, compliance checklist) so the repo can ship as a cohesive MVP bundle.

== Compliance & Audit

Run the Palimpsest compliance tools from the canonical license repo:

--
```bash
cd /mnt/eclipse/repos/palimpsest-license/tools/pmpl-verify
cargo run --manifest-path Cargo.toml -- /mnt/eclipse/repos/palimpsest-plasma --recursive --existence-only
```
--

Summary from the latest run: 0 verified, 85 missing, 0 failed (signatures not yet published). Update this log as provenance metadata is generated.

This command checks every file for an accompanying `.sig` block and reports the
verified/missing counts. Replace `--existence-only` with an empty flag once quantum-safe
signatures are available.

For a deeper compliance sweep, use:

--
```bash
cd /mnt/eclipse/repos/palimpsest-license/tools/pmpl-audit
cargo run --manifest-path Cargo.toml -- /mnt/eclipse/repos/palimpsest-plasma
```
--

Ensure your environment has the same Rust toolchain as the Palimpsest toolkit before
running these commands.

== Release Artifacts

Palimpsest Plasma MVP v1 ships the following artifacts:

* Consolidated `LICENSE`/`STATE.scm` metadata describing the PMPL-1.0 release.
* Badge/README assets in `assets/badges/` and `docs/mvp-v1.adoc` with embed guidance.
* Audit log from the `pmpl-verify`/`pmpl-audit` runs above (copy the CLI output into
  `docs/audit-report.adoc` or `ROADMAP.adoc` if needed).

Include this document in your release notes, linking to:

* `palimpsest-license/VERSIONING.adoc` for version policy.
* `palimpsest-license/assets/badges/README.md` and `embed/license-blocks/README.md` for
  badge usage.
* `palimpsest-license/legal/README.adoc` for jurisdictional/governance context.
