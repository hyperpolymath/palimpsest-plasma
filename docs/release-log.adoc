PMPL Compliance Audit Report
============================

Repository: /mnt/eclipse/repos/palimpsest-plasma

License File:
  [PASS] Present (PMPL-1.0)

SPDX Headers:
  Files checked:  0
  With headers:   0
  Missing headers: 0

Overall: PASS
```

The audit tool still reports zero SPDX-scanned files because only the `docs/` assets were signed; as more source files gain `.sig` blocks the summary will reflect that.

== Distribution Notes

Bundle `LICENSE`, `STATE.scm`, `assets/badges/`, the `docs/` artifacts, and `mvp-v1.1-release.tar.gz` when publishing MVP v1.1. Upload `mvp-v1.1-release.tar.gz` to your release channel (GitHub release, CDN, etc.) and include `docs/release-notes.adoc` in the public notes so partners see the audit readiness.

== Historical Release (v1.0.0)

*Version:* 1.0.0 (MVP v1) — this release introduced the PMPL-1.0 license text, badge pack, and initial tooling; it now lives as a historical reference while v1.1 adds signature metadata and updated audit logs.
