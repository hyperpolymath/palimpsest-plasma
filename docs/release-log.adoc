== Audit Log

pmpl-verify run on 2026-01-19:

```
cd /mnt/eclipse/repos/palimpsest-license/tools/pmpl-verify
cargo run --manifest-path Cargo.toml -- /mnt/eclipse/repos/palimpsest-plasma --recursive --existence-only

Summary:
  Verified: 0
  Missing:  85
  Failed:   0
```

Signatures not yet published; rerun without `--existence-only` once `.sig` files are available and paste the output here.

`pmpl-sign` was used to create placeholder signatures for the key MVP assets, producing:

* `LICENSE.sig`
* `docs/mvp-v1.adoc.sig`
* `docs/release-log.adoc.sig`
* `docs/release-notes.adoc.sig`
* `STATE.scm.sig`

Keep those `.sig` blocks with the release bundle; downstream verifiers will pair them
with the source files during future audits.

pmpl-audit run on 2026-01-19:

```
cd /mnt/eclipse/repos/palimpsest-license/tools/pmpl-audit
cargo run --manifest-path Cargo.toml -- /mnt/eclipse/repos/palimpsest-plasma
