= Palimpsest Plasma MVP v1 Release Notes
:toc:

== Summary

Palimpsest Plasma MVP v1 packages the canonical Palimpsest-MPL License 1.0 tooling,
badge assets, compliance documentation, and audit logs so projects can adopt PMPL-1.0
with confidence. Key deliverables:

* `LICENSE` – PMPL-1.0-or-later text
* `ECOSYSTEM.scm`, `STATE.scm` – metadata describing release state and milestones
* `assets/badges/` – v1 badge family and README
* `docs/mvp-v1.adoc` – roadmap, compliance guidance, audit commands
* `docs/release-log.adoc` – audit output from `pmpl-verify`/`pmpl-audit`
* `mvp-v1-release.tar.gz` – bundle containing the above assets

== Audit Highlights

* `pmpl-verify` (existence-only) – Verified: 0, Missing: 85, Failed: 0  
  Signatures not yet published; rerun without `--existence-only` once `.sig` files exist.
* `pmpl-audit` – PASS; license file recognized as PMPL-1.0, SPDX header scan currently
  reports zero files because no signatures/shippable sources yet.

== Distribution

Upload `mvp-v1-release.tar.gz` plus this release notes doc to your release channel (GitHub release, CDN, etc.). Mention the audit commands/output so partners see the compliance readiness. If you need me to help craft the GitHub release description or confirm the upload, let me know.
